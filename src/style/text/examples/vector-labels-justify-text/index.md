title: Vector Labels - Justify Text
name: vector-labels-justify-text

This example showcases how the text can be justified within the label box. 
By default, the text is justified according to the `nolTextAlign` property. 
However, this property justifies also the label itself according to `nolTextAlign` 
setting. To decouple the label placement from text placement (within the label box) 
use `justify`.
