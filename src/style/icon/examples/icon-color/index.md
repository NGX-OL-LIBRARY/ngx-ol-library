Example assigning a custom color to an icon. The icon styles in this example 
use images with a white fill. For some features, custom colors set using the 
`nolColor` property. Note that icon files need to obey the same origin policy or 
send proper CORS headers for this to work. When relying on CORS headers, 
the `nol-icon-style` component must be configured with `nolCrossOrigin="anonymous"`.
