## Definition
`nol-overlay` component creates a HTML element that would be displayed over the 
map and attached to a single map location. Like Control, Overlays are visible widgets. 
Unlike Controls, they are not in a fixed position on the screen, but are tied to 
a geographical coordinate, so panning the map will move an Overlay but not a Control.
