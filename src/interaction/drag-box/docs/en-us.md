## Definition

An interaction component allows the user to draw a vector box by clicking and 
dragging on the map, normally combined with an 
[condition](https://openlayers.org/en/v8.1.0/apidoc/module-ol_events_condition.html) 
that limits it to when the shift or other key is held down. This is used, for example, 
for zooming to a specific area of the map (see [DragZoom](components/drag-zoom-interaction) 
and [DragRotateAndZoom](components/drag-rotate-and-zoom-interaction) component).
