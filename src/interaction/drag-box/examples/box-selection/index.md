This example shows how to use a [DragBox](components/drag-box-interaction) 
interaction component to select features. Selected features are added to the 
feature overlay of a [select](components/select-interaction) interaction 
component for highlighting.

Use `Ctrl+Drag` (`Command+Drag` on Mac) to draw boxes.
