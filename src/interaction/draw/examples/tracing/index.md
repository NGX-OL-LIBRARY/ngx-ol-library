title: Tracing around a polygon
order: 6

The draw interaction component has a `nolTrace` property to enable tracing around 
existing features. This example uses the `nolTraceSource` property to trace features 
from one source and add them to another source. The first click on an edge of the 
target feature will start tracing. The second click on the edge will stop tracing.
