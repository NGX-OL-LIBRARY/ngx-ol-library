## Definition

An interaction component allows the user to rotate the map by clicking and 
dragging on the map, normally combined with an 
[condition](https://openlayers.org/en/v8.1.0/apidoc/module-ol_events_condition.html) 
that limits it to when the alt and shift keys are held down.

> This interaction component is one of the default interactions of a map, and 
only supported for mouse devices
