## Definition

An interaction component allows the user to zoom the map by clicking and dragging 
on the map, normally combined with an 
[condition](https://openlayers.org/en/v8.1.0/apidoc/module-ol_events_condition.html) 
that limits it to when a key, shift by default, is held down.

To change the style of the box, use CSS and the `.ol-dragzoom` selector, or your 
custom one configured with `nolClassName` property.

> This interaction component is one of the default interactions of a map.
