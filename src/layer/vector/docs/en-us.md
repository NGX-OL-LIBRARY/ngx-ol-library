## Definition

Vector data is rendered client-side, as vectors. This layer component provides most accurate rendering even during animations. Points and labels stay upright on rotated views. For very large amounts of vector data, performance may suffer during pan and zoom animations. In this case, try [nol-vector-image-layer](/components/nol-vector-image-laye/overview).
