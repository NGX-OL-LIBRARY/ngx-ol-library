## Definition

Vector data is rendered client-side, to an image. This layer component provides 
great performance during panning and zooming, but point symbols and texts are 
always rotated with the view and pixels are scaled during zoom animations. For 
more accurate rendering of vector data, use [VectorLayer](components/vector-layer) 
component instead.
