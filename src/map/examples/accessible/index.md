This example's map component has its `nolTabindex` property set to "0", that 
makes it focusable. To focus the map element you can either navigate to it using 
the "tab" key or use the skip link. When the `map` component is focused the + 
and - keys can be used to zoom in and out and the arrow keys can be used to pan.

Clicking on the "Zoom in" and "Zoom out" buttons below the map zooms the map in 
and out. You can navigate to the buttons using the "tab" key, and press the "enter" 
key to trigger the zooming action.
