## Definition

A control component to show the 2D coordinates of the mouse cursor. By default, these are 
in the view projection, but can be in any supported projection. By default the 
control is shown in the top right corner of the map, but this can be changed by 
using the css selector `.ol-mouse-position`.

On touch devices, which usually do not have a mouse cursor, the coordinates of 
the currently touched position are shown.
