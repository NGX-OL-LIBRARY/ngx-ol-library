## Definition

Provides a button that when clicked fills up the full screen with the map. The 
full screen source element is by default the element containing the map viewport 
unless overridden by providing the source option. In which case, the dom element 
introduced using this parameter will be displayed in full screen.

When in full screen mode, a close button is shown to exit full screen mode. The 
[Fullscreen API](https://www.w3.org/TR/fullscreen/) is used to toggle the map in 
full screen mode.
