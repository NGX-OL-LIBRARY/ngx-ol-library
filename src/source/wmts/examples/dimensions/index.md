Demonstrates smooth reloading of layers when changing a dimension continuously. 
The demonstration layer is a global sea-level computation (flooding computation 
from [SCALGO](https://scalgo.com/), underlying data from [CGIAR-CSI SRTM](https://cgiarcsi.community/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1)) 
where cells that are flooded if the sea-level rises to more than x m are colored blue. 
The user selects the sea-level dimension using a slider.
