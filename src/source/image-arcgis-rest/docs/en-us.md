## Definition

Source component for data from ArcGIS Rest services providing single, untiled images. Useful when underlying map service has labels.

If underlying map service is not using labels, take advantage of ol image caching and use [TileArcGISRest](/components/tile-arcgis-reset/overview) data source component.
