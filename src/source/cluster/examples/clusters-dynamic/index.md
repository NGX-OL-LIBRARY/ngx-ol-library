This example shows open data of subsidized photovoltaic installations in Vienna. 
Different style functions are used for cluster display, single feature display, 
convex hull of a cluster, and an expanded view of overlapping features. Hovering 
over a cluster shows its convex hull. Clicking on a cluster zooms to the extent 
of the contained features. Clicking on a cluster consisting of features that are 
very close to each other reveals an expanded view of the features, along a circle 
around the cluster.

Features are styled differently depending on the power of the photovoltaic installation.
